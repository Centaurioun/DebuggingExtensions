LeakShell is a tool that works in conjonction with the output of the !dumpheap command provided by the SOS.dll extension.
Each time the user copy to the clipboard the result of a "!dumpheap" command, LeakShell intercepts it, build an internal representation of the corresponding types snapshot.
Once you get several snapshots, LeakShell lets you compare them and display the allocations types that remain between two snapshots.

The first clipboard copy is used as the reference and is displayed with a yellow star in the upper snapshots list.
The other clipboard copies are used as a new current state that should be compared to the reference. 
if you want to change the current snapshot, double-click it. If you need to change the reference, select it and click on the "Set Ref" button in the upper left.
The two charts on the upper right of the window shows the evolution of the number of instances and of the size of the memory managed by the GC.

In the lower par the of the window, the differences are displayed in two forms. 
First, the "raw" tab presents a textbox from which you can copy and paste information such as method table addresses or type names.
Second, the "sorted list" tab allows you to sort the difference result by count, size or class name. 
If you want to always keep an eye on specific classes, double-click it and it will stay in the lower list. Double-click it to remove this filter.
Last but not least, classes from the BLC can be removed from the comparison by selecting the corresponding checkbox.

I hope this helps.
